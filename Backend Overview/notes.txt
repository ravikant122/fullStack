nodejs is a runtime for JS - something that can compile and run JS
that's not a lang or framework, its a runtime that can compiler and run JS
one more thing, we also have some extra things in nodejs that is build on top of V8

most widely used use case of nodejs is to create HTTP server to create backend to talk to frontend
HTTP is the protocol that let frontend and backend communicate

frontend = client
backend = server

client sends HTTP protocol(http/https) with URL and route, headers/cookies, body, method
https://chat.openai.com/backend-api/conversation
https = protocol
chat.openai.com = URL
/backend-api/conversation = route

method can be GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc.

headers contains general info like user info or cookies

HTTP server recives this request and then sends
1. response headers
2. response body - data to be used by the client with error if any
3. status code - 200(ok), 500(Internal server error)

we can create a HTTP server using express, and its a server means it is backend

nvm = node version manager - to manager diff versions on a machine if diff projects use diff node versions

to install a package - npm install <package_name>

Request methods
1. GET - to fetch some info
2. POST - to save something
3. PUT - to update something
4. DELETE - to delete something
