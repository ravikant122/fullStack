Deployment
In the old days, to make a website live, to have to buy servers machines and if very less requests are there then those machines
are useless

then came cloud computing, we can deploy our code on the cloud platforms and they gave some fixed virtual machines
but problem with that is if request are very few then the VMs are wasted and we still pay for those VMs

Serverless cloud platforms
1. AWS lambda
2. GCP
3. Cloudflare

Serverless means we pay on the basis of no. of requests and they will assign/remove the VMs as the requests comes
so we just have to write code and then the provider will take care of auto-scaling

Pros:
1. cost is very less in the begining
2. we don't have to take care of the auto-scaling

Cons:
1. as the no of requests becomes more, the cost increases too much
2. cold-start -> in the begining, when our code doesn't have any VM assigned, it takes a little bit time for provide to assign 
   some VMs

Solution for Cold start
1. keep 1 server - pay for this server always
2. keep ping in every some seconds, so that you always have 1 server alive

Cloudflare - Free of cost
but for this to use, first we've to create a clouflare project


AWS -  amazon web services
EC2 - elastic compute version 2 (its nothing but a machine which is flexible to scale)
